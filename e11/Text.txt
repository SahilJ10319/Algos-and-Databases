countFrequency(string s)
	create buckets that hold int values
		each bucket has an imaginary letter assigned to it so bucket 0 is 'a' and bucket 1 is 'b' and so on...

	count = 0

	for each letter in the string
		if(bucket in charge of the current letter in the string is empty)
			insert the value 1 in the bucket
